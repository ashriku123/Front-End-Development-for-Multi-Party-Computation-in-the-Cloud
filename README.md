# Front-End-Development-for-Multi-Party-Computation-in-the-Cloud

## Project Description

The purpose of this Project Description is to present the ideas proposed and decisions made during the preliminary envisioning and inception phase of the project. The goal is to analyze an initial concept proposal at a strategic level of detail and attain/compose an agreement between the project team members and the project customer (mentors and instructors) on the desired solution and overall project direction.

This template proposal contains a number of sections, which you can edit/modify/add/delete/organize as you like.  Some key sections weâ€™d like to have in the proposal are:

- Vision: An executive summary of the vision, goals, users, and general scope of the intended project.

- Solution Concept: the approach the project team will take to meet the business needs. This section also provides an overview of the architectural and technical designs made for implementing the project.

- Scope: the boundary of the solution defined by itemizing the intended features and functions in detail, determining what is out of scope, a release strategy and possibly the criteria by which the solution will be accepted by users and operations.

Project Proposal can be used during the follow-up analysis and design meetings to give context to efforts of more detailed technical specifications and plans. It provides a clear direction for the project team; outlines project goals, priorities, and constraints; and sets expectations.

## 1.   Vision and Goals Of The Project:

1. Set up react scaffolding using creawte-react-app
2. (Crucial work!)Set up Chris store ui by using redux to replace undux
3. Build new front end component for visulization of brain volum callculation from multiple-party compute



** **

## 2.   Scope and Features Of The Project:

The Scope places a boundary around the solution by detailing the range of features and functions of the project. This section helps to clarify the solution scope and can explicitly state what will not be delivered as well.

## 3. Solution Concept

This section provides a high-level outline of the solution.

Global Architectural Structure Of the Project:

This section provides a high-level architecture or a conceptual diagram showing the scope of the solution. If wireframes or visuals have already been done, this section could also be used to show how the intended solution will look. This section also provides a walkthrough explanation of the architectural structure.

Design Implications and Discussion:

This section discusses the implications and reasons of the design decisions made during the global architecture design.

## 4. Acceptance criteria(MVP)

This section discusses the minimum acceptance criteria at the end of the project and stretch goals.

## 5. Release Planning:
(temporary plan, modified depending on the progress...)

- sprint1(weeks 1&2): get familiar with project technology, including React, Patternfly, Redux, Undux and so on. And have a basic understand about the Chris platform and Chris UI project of redhat.
- sprint2(weeks 3&4): start the redux implementation in Chris Store, rewrite the frame by using Redux and fetch all the data object into the caches.
- sprint3(weeks 5&6): start implementing redux for the Chris UI, take all backend objexts and populate them into the cache and make them available.
- sprint4(weeks 7&8): creating some unit for testing and ensuring redux can work correctly 
- sprint5(from week9): building new front end component for visulization of brain volume calculation.

## 6. Division of Work:
